# Stained Glass Generator

An interactive art piece.
Generates patterns inspired by the beautiful stained glass rose window of Galway Cathedral.

Uses a genetic algorithm to learn user preferences.
You chooses what patterns you like and what ones you don't like and the generator will learn your preferences and generate you more patterns that you might like.
